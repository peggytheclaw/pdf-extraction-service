## 🤔 PRE-SALES QUESTIONS

### Q: "How much does it cost?"

**Answer:**
```
Great question! We have three plans:

• Starter: $49/mo - up to 200 pages/month
• Business: $149/mo - up to 1,000 pages/month  
• Enterprise: $399/mo - up to 5,000 pages/month

Most [ecommerce sellers/bookkeepers/etc.] start with [Starter/Business].

Want to see it in action first? I'm happy to do a free sample 
extraction so you can see exactly what you'd get.
```

**Why this works:**
- Transparent pricing upfront
- Anchors them to a plan
- Offers risk-free way to try

---

### Q: "What if I have more/fewer pages than the plan?"

**Answer:**
```
Good question! Here's how it works:

If you go over: We charge $0.05/page for anything over your limit
If you're under: The next month we can adjust your plan down

We're flexible - the goal is to match what you actually need.

Most customers find they fit comfortably in one plan, but we can 
always adjust if your volume changes.
```

---

### Q: "How long does extraction take?"

**Answer:**
```
Typical turnaround:
• Simple invoices: 1-2 hours
• Complex documents: 4-6 hours
• Maximum: 24 hours

Business hours (Mon-Fri 9am-6pm PST) we're usually much faster.

For paying customers, we prioritize based on when docs come in.
Most people get results the same day.
```

---

### Q: "What if the extraction is wrong?"

**Answer:**
```
Great question - accuracy is critical. Here's our guarantee:

1. We QA every extraction before sending
2. If something's wrong, we fix it immediately (no charge)
3. First week: unlimited refinements included
4. Ongoing: We learn your formats and improve over time

Our goal is 99%+ accuracy. If we can't hit that for your documents, 
we'll tell you upfront.

Want to test it? Send a sample and see for yourself!
```

---

### Q: "How secure is my data?"

**Answer:**
```
Security is our top priority:

✓ Encrypted transmission (HTTPS)
✓ Encrypted storage
✓ Documents deleted after processing
✓ Your data never used for training
✓ No third-party sharing

We can sign an NDA if needed for sensitive documents.

Industry standard: We follow same practices as [major accounting 
software / payment processors].
```

---

### Q: "Can you integrate with [QuickBooks/Xero/etc.]?"

**Answer:**
```
Right now: We deliver CSV/Excel files you can import

Coming soon: Direct integrations with QuickBooks, Xero, and other 
popular accounting software.

The CSV export is formatted to make importing easy (we can match 
your existing fields).

If you need a specific integration, let me know - if we get enough 
requests for one platform, we prioritize building it!
```

---

### Q: "What formats do you support?"

**Answer:**
```
We handle:
✓ PDF (text-based or scanned)
✓ Images (JPG, PNG)
✓ Screenshots
✓ Scanned documents (OCR)

✓ Invoices
✓ Receipts  
✓ Purchase orders
✓ Bank statements
✓ Shipping documents
✓ Custom forms

If it has structured data, we can probably extract it. Send a sample 
and we'll confirm!
```

---

### Q: "Do you use AI / Is this AI?"

**Answer:**
```
Yes, we use AI to help build extraction scripts faster, but every 
output is validated for accuracy.

Think of it like: AI helps us work faster, but you're getting a 
service with human oversight - not just raw AI output.

Best of both worlds: speed of AI + reliability of human verification.
```

**Note:** Keep AI mention light - focus on results, not tech

### Q: "Why not just use [Competitor]?"

**Common Competitors:**
- Docparser
- Nanonets  
- Rossum
- Manual VA services

**Answer:**
```
Great question! The main differences:

Us vs. [Docparser/Tools]:
• Service not software - we build extractors FOR you
• No learning curve or templates to configure
• Human verification included

Us vs. [VAs/Manual]:
• Faster turnaround (hours not days)
• More accurate (scripted extraction + QA)
• Scales with your business

Us vs. [Enterprise tools like Rossum]:
• Much more affordable ($49 vs. $10K+/mo)
• No complex setup or sales calls
• Built for small businesses

Best fit: If you want it handled for you without the enterprise 
price tag or DIY complexity.
```

## 💰 PRICING OBJECTIONS

### Q: "That's expensive / Can I get a discount?"

**Answer:**
```
I get it - let's look at the math:

If you process [X] invoices/month at [Y] minutes each:
= [Z] hours of manual work
= $[cost] in labor at $[hourly rate]

Our service: $[plan price]

You save: $[difference] per month

Plus: You get [Z] hours back to focus on growing your business 
instead of data entry.

For most customers, it pays for itself in the first week.

Still not sure? Try the free sample and see if it's worth it!
```

**Alternative (if still resistant):**
```
Tell you what - try Starter plan for first month. If you don't 
feel like it saved you enough time, I'll refund it. Fair?
```

---

### Q: "Can I just pay per document?"

**Answer:**
```
Right now we're focused on monthly plans because it gives us 
predictable volume to deliver consistent turnaround times.

That said, if you have very low volume (like <20 pages/month), 
let me know. We might be able to work out a custom arrangement.

What volume are you typically processing?
```

**Internal note:** Consider adding pay-per-doc tier if many people ask

## 🔧 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### Q: "How do I send documents?"

**Answer:**
```
Super easy - three ways:

1. Email: Just email to invoices@[domain]
2. Upload: Go to [domain]/upload and drag/drop
3. API: If you have dev resources (coming soon)

Most customers use email - simplest workflow.

You can CC: your bookkeeper, add to existing email threads, 
whatever works for you.
```

---

### Q: "What output format do I get?"

**Answer:**
```
Your choice:
• CSV (most common)
• Excel
• JSON (for developers)

We can customize column names to match your existing spreadsheets 
or accounting software imports.

Just let us know what works best for you!
```

---

### Q: "What if my invoices have line items?"

**Answer:**
```
We handle line items! Each line becomes a row in your output:

Example:
Invoice #123
  Line 1: Widget A, $50
  Line 2: Widget B, $75

Output:
Invoice, Line, Item, Amount
123, 1, Widget A, $50
123, 2, Widget B, $75

Or we can nest them - whatever format you prefer.

Send a sample and I'll show you exactly how we'd structure it!
```

---

### Q: "Can you handle [weird/complex format]?"

**Answer:**
```
Maybe! We handle most standard invoices, but let's test yours.

Send a sample and I'll:
1. Extract it manually to show you what we can get
2. Be honest if there's anything we can't handle reliably
3. Suggest workarounds if needed

Better to know upfront than promise something we can't deliver!
```

Pro tips (optional):

We handle the rest!
```

---

### Q: "How long is the contract?"

**Answer:**
```
No contract! Month-to-month, cancel anytime.

You can:
• Pause if you don't need it for a month
• Cancel with zero fees or penalties
• Upgrade/downgrade plans anytime

We keep customers by being useful, not by locking you in.
```

## 😰 OBJECTIONS & CONCERNS

### Q: "I'm not sure if this is right for me..."

**Answer:**
```
Totally fair! Let's figure it out together.

Tell me:
1. How many invoices do you process per month?
2. What's your current process?
3. What's the biggest pain point about it?

If we're a good fit, I'll tell you. If not, I'll be honest about 
that too - might even suggest an alternative that works better.

Sound good?
```

---

### Q: "I need to think about it..."

**Answer:**
```
Absolutely! No pressure.

Here's what I'd suggest:
1. Try the free sample if you haven't yet
2. See exactly what you'd get
3. Do the math on time saved vs. cost
4. Then decide

If you don't think about it again, that's totally fine too. But if 
you do want to try it, you know where to find me!

### Q: "Let me talk to my [partner/accountant/team]..."

**Answer:**
```
Makes total sense! Here's what might help:

I can send you:
• Sample extraction (show them what output looks like)
• Pricing comparison (vs. manual labor cost)
• Case study (if we have one from similar business)

Or I'm happy to jump on a quick call with you + [partner/accountant] 
to answer their questions.

What would be most helpful?
```
