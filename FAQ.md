# FAQ - PDF Extraction Service

## Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions from potential customers and clients.

---

## General Questions

### What exactly is your service?

We extract data from your supplier invoice PDFs and format it for easy import into your accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).

Instead of manually typing line items from PDF invoices into your accounting system, you send us the PDFs and we send back structured data (Excel/CSV) ready to import.

**What we extract:**
- Line items (SKU, description, quantity, unit price, totals)
- Invoice metadata (invoice #, date, PO#, due date)
- Supplier information
- Tax and shipping details

---

### How does it work?

**Simple 4-step process:**

1. **You send invoices** - Email or upload your supplier invoice PDFs
2. **We extract data** - We pull all the line items and details
3. **We send it back** - You get formatted Excel/CSV files
4. **You import** - One-click import into QuickBooks/Xero

Typical turnaround: 24-48 hours depending on volume.

---

### Who is this for?

This service is ideal for:

✅ **Amazon FBA sellers** with multiple suppliers
✅ **Shopify store owners** dealing with physical products
✅ **Multi-channel sellers** managing inventory across platforms
✅ **eCommerce brands** with 10+ invoices per month
✅ **Anyone** who's tired of manual invoice data entry

**Best fit:** Sellers processing 20+ supplier invoices per month who use QuickBooks or Xero.

---

### How much time will this save me?

**Average time savings:**
- Manual entry: 15-25 minutes per invoice
- Our service: 2-3 minutes per invoice (just review and import)
- **Time saved: ~20 minutes per invoice**

**Real examples:**
- 20 invoices/month = **~6-7 hours saved**
- 40 invoices/month = **~13-15 hours saved**
- 60 invoices/month = **~20-24 hours saved**

Plus: Eliminates data entry errors and the mental drain of tedious work.

---

### How accurate is the extraction?

**Our accuracy target: 99.5%+**

We use a combination of:
1. Automated extraction tools (initial capture)
2. Human QA review (catch errors)
3. Math verification (totals must match)

Every invoice is reviewed by a human before delivery. We don't just run OCR and send it to you - we verify everything.

**What if there's an error?**
If you find an error in our extraction, we fix it immediately at no charge.

---

### What file formats do you accept?

**We accept:**
- ✅ PDF (standard format, searchable text)
- ✅ PDF (scanned/image-based - we use OCR)
- ✅ JPG/PNG images (invoice photos)

**We can't process:**
- ❌ Paper invoices (send us a photo or scan, then we can)
- ❌ Handwritten invoices (very low accuracy, not recommended)

If you have a weird format, reach out - we can probably handle it.

---

### What accounting systems do you support?

**Formatted for:**
- QuickBooks Online
- QuickBooks Desktop
- Xero
- Generic CSV/Excel (works with most systems)

We format the data specifically for your accounting system's import requirements.

**Using something else?**
Let us know - we can usually create a custom format for your system.

## Pricing Questions

### How much does it cost?

**Two pricing options:**

**Option 1: Monthly Unlimited**
- $179/month
- Unlimited invoices
- 24-hour turnaround
- Priority support
- Cancel anytime, no contract

**Option 2: Pay-Per-Batch**
- $45 for up to 20 invoices
- $79 for 21-50 invoices
- 48-hour turnaround
- Good for seasonal sellers

**First-time customer offer:** 50% off first month ($89)

**No contracts, cancel anytime.**

For monthly subscriptions:
- Cancel before your next billing date

- Email us within 30 days
- We'll refund your payment, no questions asked

We're confident you'll love the service, but if not, you risk nothing.

---

## Comparison Questions

### How is this different from hiring a VA?

**Our service vs. Virtual Assistant:**

| | PDF Extraction Service | Virtual Assistant |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | $179/month | $400-800/month |
| **Turnaround** | 24-48 hours | Depends on availability |
| **Accuracy** | 99.5% (QA + tools) | Varies (human error) |
| **Scalability** | Unlimited invoices | Limited by VA hours |
| **Consistency** | Same quality every time | Depends on VA |
| **Training** | None needed | Need to train, manage |

**Best of both worlds:** We combine automation tools + human QA for speed and accuracy.

---

### How is this different from OCR software?

**Our service vs. DIY OCR:**

| | PDF Extraction Service | OCR Software (DIY) |
|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | 99.5% (human QA) | 85-95% (no QA) |
| **Setup time** | Zero (we handle it) | Hours (learning curve) |
| **Error fixing** | We fix before delivery | You fix everything |
| **Complex invoices** | We handle manually | Often fails |
| **Your time** | 2-3 min/invoice | 10-15 min/invoice |

**OCR is only part of the solution.** We do OCR + human QA + formatting + error correction.

---

### Can't I just do this myself?

**You absolutely can!**

But consider:
- Your time cost (what's your hourly rate?)
- Error risk (typos → accounting headaches)
- Mental drain (tedious work is exhausting)
- Opportunity cost (what else could you do with those hours?)

**Example:**
- You value your time at $50/hour
- You spend 10 hours/month on invoice entry
- That's $500/month of your time
- Our service: $179/month
- **Net savings: $321/month + no more tedious work**

Some sellers prefer doing it themselves - totally valid! But most find outsourcing this task is worth it.

---

## Technical Questions

### What technology do you use?

**Our process:**

1. **Automated extraction**: OCR and PDF parsing tools (Tesseract, pdfplumber, AI vision models)
2. **Human QA**: Every invoice reviewed by a human
3. **Error detection**: Automated math verification
4. **Formatting**: Custom scripts for QuickBooks/Xero compatibility

**It's a hybrid approach** - automation for speed, humans for accuracy.

---

### Is my data secure?

**Yes, we take security seriously:**

- ✅ Encrypted file uploads (HTTPS)
- ✅ Secure cloud storage (AWS/Google Cloud)
- ✅ No data sharing with third parties
- ✅ PDFs deleted after processing (unless you ask us to keep)
- ✅ SOC 2 compliance (on roadmap)

**Your invoices contain business info, not customer data** - lower risk than payment processing.

---

### What if a file won't upload?

**Troubleshooting file uploads:**

1. **File too large**: Try compressing PDF or send in batches
2. **Format issue**: Convert to standard PDF format
3. **Corrupted file**: Re-export from original source
4. **Email us**: We'll send alternative upload method

**File size limit:** 50MB per file (more than enough for invoices)

---

### Can I access my historical extracted data?

---

## Objection Handling

### "This sounds too expensive"

**Let's do the math:**

Scenario: You process 30 invoices/month
- Your time: 15 min/invoice × 30 = 7.5 hours
- Your hourly value: $30/hour (conservative)
- Cost of doing it yourself: $225/month
- Our service: $179/month
- **Net savings: $46/month + no more tedious work**

**Plus:**
- Fewer errors (saves time fixing mistakes)
- More time for high-value work (product development, marketing)
- Mental energy freed up (tedious work is draining)

**Not about cost - it's about value.** Where else can you buy back 7-10 hours per month?

---

### "I'll just hire a VA for this"

**That's a valid option! Here's why some choose us instead:**

1. **Cost**: Good VAs cost $5-10/hour × 10 hours = $50-100/month... but then you need to:
   - Find and vet them (time)
   - Train them on your systems (time + errors)
   - Manage them ongoing (time)
   - Risk turnover (start over)

2. **Quality**: VAs are human - they make typos too. Our process includes QA.

3. **Scalability**: VA has limited hours. We can handle unlimited volume.

**VAs are great for many tasks!** But for this specific repetitive data entry task, specialized service often works better.

---

### "I don't have that many invoices"

**How many invoices do you process per month?**

- **1-10 invoices/month**: You're right, probably not worth it yet. Bookmark us for when you scale!
- **10-20 invoices/month**: Pay-per-batch ($45) might be worth testing
- **20+ invoices/month**: Monthly unlimited ($179) likely pays for itself

**Also consider:**
- Are you growing? (Will you have more invoices in 6 months?)
- What's your time worth? (Even 5 invoices = ~1.5 hours saved)
- Quality of life (is this task draining you?)

---

### "I'll think about it"

**Totally understandable! Here's what I'd suggest:**

1. **Try the free sample** - See the quality with zero risk
2. **Calculate your time cost** - Track how long invoice entry actually takes
3. **Consider opportunity cost** - What would you do with 10 extra hours?

**No pressure** - we'll be here when you're ready. Bookmark us or email peggy@pdfextraction.service when timing is right.

---

### "What if your service goes away?"

**Fair question. Here's our longevity plan:**

1. **Profitable model**: We charge enough to sustain the business long-term
2. **Growing demand**: More sellers need this as ecommerce scales
3. **No contracts**: You're not locked in, so we earn your business daily
4. **Your data**: You keep all extracted data (we're not a dependency)

**Worst case:** We shut down, you go back to manual entry or find alternative. But you'll have saved hundreds of hours by then.

---

## Specific Use Cases

### "I have 100+ SKUs per invoice"

**No problem - we handle high-complexity invoices:**

- Processed invoices with 500+ line items
- Pricing stays the same (unlimited line items per invoice)
- May need slightly longer turnaround (48 hours vs 24)

Send us a sample - we'll show you.

---

### "My supplier invoices are in Chinese"

**We can handle Chinese invoices:**

- Simplified Chinese: Yes, we process regularly
- Traditional Chinese: Yes
- OCR accuracy may be slightly lower (~95%)

Send a sample - we'll confirm we can handle your specific format.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My invoice format is really weird"

**We love a challenge!**

- Most "weird" formats are processable
- Send us a sample (we'll review within 24 hours)
- If we can't do it accurately, we'll tell you upfront

**No invoice format has stumped us yet** (but there's always a first time!).

---

### "I tried OCR software and it didn't work"

**Totally common - here's why we're different:**

1. **We use multiple tools**: If one OCR fails, we try another
2. **Human QA**: We fix OCR errors before delivery
3. **Manual fallback**: Complex invoices get manual extraction
4. **Experience**: We've seen thousands of invoice formats

**What failed for you?** We probably have a solution.

---

### "The PDF is password-protected"

**Easy fix:**

- Email us the password with the PDF, or
- Unlock the PDF before sending (use PDF tools)

We'll handle password-protected PDFs if you give us the password.
