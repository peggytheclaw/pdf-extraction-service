## 🎯 TEMPLATE 1: Initial Outreach (eCommerce Sellers)

### Subject Lines (Test These):
```
Quick question about invoice processing
[Name] - idea for [business name]
Spending time on manual data entry?
How do you handle supplier invoices?
```

### Email Body:
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're selling [product category] on Amazon/Shopify. 
Quick question:

How do you currently handle extracting data from supplier 
invoices? (vendor name, amounts, line items, etc.)

Most sellers I talk to spend 2-3 hours per week manually 
typing this stuff into spreadsheets or QuickBooks.

We built a service that does it for you:
→ You email/upload your invoices
→ We extract the data
→ You get clean CSVs/Excel back (usually within hours)

Want to try it with one of your invoices? I'll do it for 
free to show you what we can do.

Just reply with a sample attached (or let me know if this 
isn't relevant for you).

## 📧 TEMPLATE 2: Initial Outreach (Bookkeepers)

### Subject Lines:
```
Quick question - bookkeeping automation
Idea for [company name]
Client invoice processing?
```

### Email Body:
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you're a bookkeeper working with [X] clients. 
Quick question:

How much time do you spend manually entering invoice data 
for your clients each month?

Most bookkeepers I talk to say it's 5-10 hours/week across 
all their clients - tedious work that nobody enjoys.

We built a service specifically for bookkeepers:
→ Your clients' invoices come in
→ We extract all the data (vendor, amounts, dates, etc.)
→ You get structured files ready for QuickBooks/Xero

Want to try it with one client? I'll process 5 invoices for 
free to show you how much time it saves.

Just reply and let me know!
