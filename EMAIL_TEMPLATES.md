## Email #1: Initial Contact (Personalized)

### Template A: Pain Point Recognition (Reddit/Forum Source)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Saw your post about supplier invoices on Reddit"
- "Re: Invoice management for [Company Name]"
- "[First Name] - quick question about your QB workflow"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across your post on r/FulfillmentByAmazon about [specific pain point they mentioned]. I work with a lot of Amazon sellers dealing with the exact same problem - manually entering supplier invoices into QuickBooks is brutal when you're doing 20, 30, 50+ a month.

Quick question: Are you still copy-pasting line items from PDF invoices, or have you found a better system?

I ask because we built a service that extracts all the data from supplier PDFs automatically (line items, totals, PO numbers, everything) and formats it ready to import into QB. Most sellers save 5-10 hours per month.

Would it be helpful if I processed a few of your invoices as a free sample? Takes me 10 minutes, you can see if it actually saves you time.

No pressure either way - just thought it might help based on what you mentioned.

Best,
Peggy

Hi [First Name],

I help ecommerce sellers like [Company Name] automate the tedious part of invoice processing - extracting data from supplier PDFs and getting it into QuickBooks.

Most sellers I work with are manually copy-pasting line items from 20-50+ invoices per month. It's:
• Time-consuming (5-10 hours/month)
• Error-prone (typos = accounting headaches)
• Not scalable (grows with every new SKU/supplier)

The alternative: Send me your invoice PDFs, get back structured data (CSV/Excel) ready to import into QB. 

**Free sample offer:** Send me 3-5 of your messiest invoices. I'll extract all the data and send it back formatted for your accounting system. Zero obligation - just want to show you what's possible.

Worth 10 minutes to see if this saves you hours?

Let me know,
Peggy

### Template C: Shopify Store Owner (Found via Store Research)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "RE: [Store Name] - invoice processing question"
- "How do you handle supplier invoices at [Store Name]?"
- "[First Name], automate your invoice entry?"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Store Name] while researching Shopify sellers who work with physical product suppliers. Great store - love the [specific product/niche].

Quick question: How are you currently handling supplier invoice data entry into your accounting system? 

Most Shopify sellers I work with are manually entering line items from PDF invoices into QuickBooks/Xero. It's manageable with 1-2 suppliers, but gets painful fast as you scale.

I run a service that extracts all the data from invoice PDFs automatically:
✓ Line items (SKU, description, quantity, unit price)
✓ Totals, taxes, shipping
✓ PO numbers, dates, supplier info
✓ Formatted ready to import into your accounting software

**Free sample**: Send me 3-5 invoices, I'll extract everything and send back a formatted spreadsheet. Takes me about 10 minutes, shows you exactly what you'd get.

If it saves you time, great. If not, no worries - at least you'll have those invoices processed.

Interested?

## Email #2: Follow-up 1 (Day 3) - Value Add

### Template: The Helpful Follow-Up

**Subject Line:**
- "Re: [Original Subject]"
- "Quick follow up + free resource"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Monday about automating your invoice data entry.

I know you're busy, so I won't take much time. I put together a quick guide that might help even if you don't use my service:

**"5 Ways to Speed Up Invoice Entry (Even Without Automation)"**

1. Standardize supplier invoice formats (ask them to use a template)
2. Use QB's batch import feature (save 30% time)
3. Set up keyboard shortcuts for common entries
4. Group invoices by supplier before starting
5. Use dual monitors (invoice on one, QB on the other)

Sounds basic, but most sellers skip #1 and #2 and it costs them hours.

---

**That said**, if you're doing 20+ invoices per month, automation probably saves more time than optimization. 

My offer still stands: **Send me 3-5 invoices, I'll extract all the data free as a sample.** No credit card, no signup, just a real example of what you'd get.

Takes me 10 minutes to process, could save you 5-10 hours per month if you like it.

Reply with "YES" and I'll send you the upload link.

Best,
Peggy

P.S. - Current clients are saving an average of 8 hours per month. Happy to share references if that's helpful.

## Email #3: Follow-up 2 (Day 7) - Case Study + Direct Offer

### Template: Social Proof + Urgency

**Subject Line:**

- "How Sarah saved 12 hours/month (real numbers)"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Last email from me on this (promise!).

I wanted to share a quick case study that's relevant to you:

**Case Study: Sarah - Shopify Seller (Supplements)**

**Before:**
- 45 supplier invoices per month
- 8-10 hours spent on manual data entry
- 2-3 errors per month (duplicate entries, typos)
- Always behind on reconciliation

**After:** (Using our service for 3 months)
- Same 45 invoices, now processed automatically
- 30 minutes per month (just reviewing/importing)
- Zero data entry errors
- Caught 2 supplier billing mistakes because she actually had time to review

**Time saved: 9.5 hours per month**
**Cost: $179/month (pays for itself if you value your time at $18/hour)**

---

**My offer to you:**

1. **Free sample** (this week): Send 3-5 invoices, get them processed free
2. **First month 50% off** if you like the results: $89 instead of $179
3. **Cancel anytime** - no contract, no commitment

I have capacity for 5 new clients this month. If invoice data entry is sucking up your time, let's fix it.

Reply "SAMPLE" and I'll send the upload link today.

Best,
Peggy

P.S. - If invoice processing isn't a pain point for you, no worries! Feel free to ignore this. But if you're spending 5+ hours per month on it, those are hours you could spend growing your business.

I wanted to make sure:
1. The format worked for your accounting system

### Template B: Hard Close (For High-Intent Leads)

**Subject Line:**
- "Last call: 50% off expires Friday"
- "[First Name], ready to automate your invoices?"
- "Final follow-up - invoice automation"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I don't want to be a pest, so this is my last email about the invoice extraction service.

You got the free sample showing what's possible. If it works for you, great - I'd love to have you as a client. If not, totally understand!

**Here's the deal:**

The 50% off first month offer expires this Friday (Feb 14).

After that, it's full price ($179/month) for new clients.

**If you're on the fence**, here's what past clients wished they knew before starting:

✓ "I should've started 6 months ago - I wasted so many hours"
✓ "The sample looked good, but I didn't realize how much MENTAL load this would remove"
✓ "I thought $179 was expensive until I calculated I was spending 10 hours/month at $35/hour = $350 in my time"
✓ "The error reduction alone was worth it - caught a $2,400 supplier mistake in month 2"

**To start:**
1. Reply "START" to this email
2. I'll send you the onboarding form (5 minutes)
3. You'll have invoice processing running by Wednesday

Or, if this isn't the right time, no worries! Feel free to reach out when invoice volume becomes a headache.

Either way - thanks for your time, and best of luck with [Company Name]!

Best,
Peggy

**P.S.** - The offer is first month 50% off ($89), cancel anytime. If you process 25+ invoices and it doesn't save you at least 4 hours in month one, I'll refund you personally.

## Email #6: Re-engagement (30 Days Later)

### Template: For Non-Responders

**Subject Line:**
- "Quick check-in - [First Name]"
- "Is now a better time?"
- "Following up from January"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Peggy here - I reached out last month about automating your supplier invoice data entry. You didn't respond, which probably means:

A) You're not interested (totally fine!)
B) It got buried in your inbox (happens to everyone)
C) Timing wasn't right (also fine!)

I'm following up ONE more time because we just onboarded 3 new clients this month and they're all saving 6-12 hours per month on invoice processing.

**If you're still manually entering invoice data**, my offer stands:

→ Send me 3-5 invoices for a free sample
→ See the exact output you'd get
→ Decide if it's worth automating

**If you're NOT interested**, just reply "NOT INTERESTED" and I'll remove you from my list. No hard feelings!

Either way, hope [Company Name] is crushing it.

Best,
Peggy

## Response Handling Scripts

### When They Say "What's the pricing?"

```
Great question! 

Two options:

1. **Monthly Unlimited**: $179/month for unlimited invoices, 24-hour turnaround, cancel anytime

2. **Pay-Per-Batch**: $45 (up to 20 invoices) or $79 (21-50 invoices), 48-hour turnaround

Most sellers choose monthly if they process 20+ invoices per month (breaks even at about 8-10 hours of time savings).

How many invoices are you typically processing per month?
```

---

### When They Say "This sounds too good to be true"

```
Ha! I get that. It's not magic - it's just structured data extraction from PDFs combined with human QA.

Here's what I actually do:

1. Run your invoice PDFs through extraction software (captures ~95% of data)
2. Manually review and correct any errors (the other ~5%)
3. Format it for your specific accounting system
4. Flag any anomalies (duplicate entries, pricing mismatches, etc.)

The "secret" is that I batch-process invoices for multiple clients, so I can offer it cheaper than hiring someone full-time to do this in-house.

Want to see it in action? Send me 3-5 invoices and I'll process them free so you can verify the quality yourself. No credit card, no signup - just a real sample.
```

---

### When They Say "I'll think about it"

```
Totally understand! This is a process change, so it makes sense to think it through.

A few questions that might help your decision:

1. How many hours per month are you (or your team) spending on invoice data entry right now?
2. What's the biggest pain point - the time, the errors, or the mental load?
3. What would free up 8-10 hours per month let you do? (Work on product development? Marketing? Actually take a day off?)

If you want, I can still process 3-5 invoices as a free sample while you think it over. That way you have real data to base your decision on, not just my sales pitch.

No pressure though - take your time!
```

---

### When They Say "We're using [Competitor/Tool]"

```
That's great! How's it working for you?

[Listen to their response]

If they're happy: "Awesome - sounds like you have a good system. If anything changes or you need backup support during busy periods, feel free to reach out!"

If they're frustrated: "Yeah, I've heard that from other sellers about [Tool]. The main differences with our service are [specific advantages]. Want to try a free sample and compare quality?"
```
