## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Privacy & Ethics:
- All leads from public sources (forums, LinkedIn, public profiles)
- Personalized emails, NOT spam blasts
- CAN-SPAM compliant (unsubscribe available)
- No purchased lists
- Stop after 3 emails if no response

### Realistic Expectations:
- 5-10% reply rate = GOOD for cold email
- 20-50% sample→customer conversion = GREAT
- First customer might take 1-2 weeks
- Month 1: $100-500 MRR is realistic for validation phase

### This Is Validation:
- Goal: Prove 3-5 people will pay
- Manual service is fine at first
- Build automation AFTER validating demand
- Don't over-engineer before product-market fit

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**After 2 weeks, we'll know if this works:**

✅ **VALIDATED** (Continue & Scale):
- 5%+ reply rate to cold emails
- 20%+ sample→customer conversion  
- 1-3 paying customers
- Customers re-order (send more docs)

❌ **PIVOT** (Try different approach):
